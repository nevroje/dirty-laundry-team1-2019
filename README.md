March 2019 Mid Course Project

We created a time slot booking application for laundry booking ease. You can sign up with your e-mail or with facebook.

Once you are signed in you will be able to access the links on the calendar itself. Booked time links are disabled. When you click on a time slot to book a confirmation message will flash in which you verify the booking. You are allowed up to 4 bookings a month unless you purchase a family subscription, which is charged to your credit card through using stripe payments.
